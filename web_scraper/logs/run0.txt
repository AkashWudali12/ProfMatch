CubeSats offer a low-cost means to improve the likelihood of a joint detection by increasing sky coverage and sensitivity. Aiming to fulfill this objective, BurstCube was a 6U (10 x 20 x 30 cm 3) CubeSat designed to detect, localize, and rapidly disseminate information about GRBs from across the visible sky unocculted by the earth. BurstCube's instrument was sensitive between 50 keV to 1 MeV and consisted of four Thallium-doped cesium iodide (CsI) scintillators coupled to banks of silicon photo-multiplier (SiPM) arrays. BurstCube's on-board triggering algorithm was designed with the capability to deliver alerts of observed GRBs …\n\nTitle: Swift-BAT GUANO follow-up of gravitational-wave triggers in the third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run\n\nDescription:\n\nThe discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBH) by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) opened a new window to the Universe (BP Abbott et al. 2016a). In addition to GWs, compact binary mergers with at least one neutron star (NS) component are likely to generate electromagnetic (EM) radiation (eg, E. Nakar 2020; K. Kyutoku et al. 2021). Coincident detection of EM emission from compact binary mergers provides a complete picture of the merger process and can have huge implications for our understanding of the Universe. Such coincidences play a crucial role in tracing the properties of the source host galaxy (KD Alexander et al. 2017; E. Troja et al. 2017), mitigating degeneracies in GW parameter estimation (SA Hughes & DE Holz 2003; BP Abbott et al. 2017a; H. Wang & D. Giannios 2021), placing constraints on the NS equation of state (A. Bauswein et al. 2017; D. Radice et al. 2018), and investigating the expansion rate of the Universe, thereby testing cosmological models (BF Schutz 1986; S. Nissanke et al. 2013; BP Abbott et al. 2017a, 2017b; K. Hotokezaka et al. 2019). Additionally, they allow for the measurement of arrival time differences between photons and gravitons, providing limits on the mass of a graviton, and exploring potential violations to the equivalence principle and Lorentz invariance (BP Abbott 2017e).\n\n", 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Lc-aQ3QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'pshawhan@umd.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': 'S.', 'added_to_pinecone': False}], count=None)

In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there “floating” with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results …\n\nTitle: Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene\n\nDescription:\n\nWe study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han et al. [arXiv:2408.15233]. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of Fermi surface nesting, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the , , and the nodal -wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region, consistent with experimental …\n\nTitle: Dephasing of planar Ge hole spin qubits due to charge noise\n\nDescription:\n\nHole spin qubits in Ge, investigated for all-electrical spin manipulation because of their large spin-orbit coupling, are exposed to charge noise, leading to decoherence. Here, we employ a model of noise due to individual fluctuators and determine the dephasing time as a function of qubit properties. decreases with increasing magnetic field and is an order of magnitude longer for out-of-plane fields than for in-plane fields for the same Zeeman energy. shows little variation as a function of the top gate field and is a complex function of the dot radius. Our results should help experiments enhance coherence in hole qubit architectures.\n\nTitle: Vision transformer based deep learning of topological indicators in Majorana nanowires\n\nDescription:\n\nOne-dimensional superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation because of their ability to host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder-induced Andreev bound states. Recent studies clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we use a generalized vision transformer-based neural network to predict, using tunnel conductance measurements, whether a device manifests a topological MZM phase in the presence of disorder and to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We demonstrate the ability of our method to classify with arbitrary confidence whether a device as …\n\nTitle: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene with a strong displacement field\n\nDescription:\n\nWe investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.\n\nTitle: Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a Majorana qubit in a quantum dot-superconductor array\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance—longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities—compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum-dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot …\n\nTitle: Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers\n\nDescription:\n\nRecently, robust superconductivity has been independently reported in twisted bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., Nature (London) 637, 839 (2025)10.1038/s41586-024-08381-1]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted bilayers. Using a continuum band structure and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite very different experimental conditions, both twisted samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength for superconductivity. This consistency in the two experiments suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism. We speculate on …\n\nTitle: Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control\n\nDescription:\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. Our approach, which we demonstrate with numerically simulated devices, takes advantage of currently used experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intrasite and intersite Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy …\n\n', 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qr4xe_YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'dassarma@umd.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': 'Das', 'added_to_pinecone': False}], count=None)

EIC [8] is also among possible recipients of the R&D program developed in this DRD-on-Calorimetry. The ECFA Detector Roadmap [9] has defined the following Detector R&D Themes (DRDTs):\n\nTitle: Small- evolution of gluon fields from incoherent photoproduction in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions\n\nDescription:\n\nIncoherent J/ψ photoproduction in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), in which the photon interacts with localized, fluctuating gluonic hotspots rather than the entire nucleus, provides a unique probe of those fluctuations. This study presents the first measurement of the dependence of this photoproduction yield on the photonnucleon center-of-mass energy (WγN), using PbPb UPCs at a nucleon-nucleon centerof-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The data corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.52 nb− 1, recorded by the CMS experiment. The measurement covers a wide WγN range of≈ 40–400 GeV, probing gluons carrying a fraction of nucleon momentum x in the range between 5.9× 10− 3 and 6.5× 10− 5. The measured incoherent J/ψ photoproduction cross section is suppressed relative to theoretical predictions without nuclear effects. However, the ratio of incoherent to coherent photoproduction remains constant across the probed WγN and x range. Together, these results pose significant challenges to current theoretical models which include gluon saturation or nuclear shadowing effects.\n\nTitle: Observation of the charged-particle multiplicity dependence of in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nBound states of charm and anticharm quarks, known as charmonia, have a rich spectroscopic structure that can be used to probe the dynamics of hadron production in high-energy hadron collisions. Here, the cross section ratio of excited and ground state vector mesons is measured as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass (CM) energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 175 nb were collected using the CMS detector. The ratio is measured separately for prompt and nonprompt charmonia in the transverse momentum range 6.530 GeV and in four rapidity ranges spanning 2.865 1.935. For the first time, a statistically significant multiplicity dependence of the prompt cross section ratio is observed in proton-nucleus collisions. There is no clear rapidity dependence in the ratio. The prompt measurements are compared with a theoretical model which includes interactions with nearby particles during the evolution of the system. These results provide additional constraints on hadronization models of heavy quarks in nuclear collisions.\n\nTitle: arXiv: The IDEA detector concept for FCC-ee\n\nDescription:\n\nA detector concept, named IDEA, optimized for the physics and running conditions at the FCC-ee is presented. After discussing the expected running conditions and the main physics drivers, a detailed description of the individual sub-detectors is given. These include: a very light tracking system with a powerful vertex detector inside a large drift chamber surrounded by a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual readout fiber calorimeter and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke. Some examples of the expected detector performance, based on fast and full simulation, are also given.\n\nTitle: Search for medium effects using jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets from PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nThe jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets is studied using lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The jet axis decorrelation is defined as the angular difference between two definitions of the jet axis. It is obtained by applying two recombination schemes on all the constituents of a given jet reconstructed by the anti-kT sequential algorithm with a distance parameter of R= 0.4. The data set, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.66 nb− 1, was collected in 2018 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The jet axis decorrelations are examined across collision centrality selections and intervals of jet transverse momentum. A centrality dependent evolution of the measured distributions is observed, with a progressive narrowing seen in more central events. This narrowing could result from medium-induced modification of the internal jet structure or reflect color charge effects in energy loss. This new measurement probes jet substructure in previously unexplored kinematic domains and show great promise for providing new insights on the color charge dependence of energy loss to jet-quenching models.\n\nTitle: Observation of hyperon local polarization in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nThe polarization of the A and A hyperons along the beam direction has been measured in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data were obtained with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0±6.5 nb− 1. A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon polarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient Pz, s2, is observed. The Pz, s2 values decrease as a function of charged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A hydrodynamic model that describes the observed Pz, s2 values in nucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce either the sign or the magnitude of the pPb results. These observations pose a challenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in heavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin polarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.\n\nTitle: Evidence for similar collectivity of high transverse momentum particles in pPb and PbPb collisions\n\nDescription:\n\nCharged hadron elliptic anisotropies (v2) are presented over a wide transverse momentum (pT) range for proton-lead (pPb) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at nucleonnucleon center-of-mass energies of 8.16 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment and correspond to integrated luminosities of 186 nb− 1 and 0.607 nb− 1 for the pPb and PbPb systems, respectively. A four-particle cumulant analysis is performed using subevents separated in pseudorapidity to effectively suppress non-collective effects. At high pT (pT> 8 GeV), significant positive v2 values are observed that are similar between pPb and PbPb collisions at comparable charged particle multiplicities. This observation suggests a common origin for the multi-particle collectivity for high-pT particles in the two systems.\n\nTitle: Search for production and constraints on the Yukawa couplings of light quarks to the Higgs boson\n\nDescription:\n\nA search for γH production is performed with data from the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138fb− 1 at a proton-proton center-of-mass collision energy of 13TeV. The analysis focuses on the topology of a boosted Higgs boson recoiling against a high-energy photon. The final states of H→ bb and H→ 4ℓ are analyzed. This study examines effective HZγ and Hγγ anomalous couplings within the context of an effective field theory. In this approach, the production cross section is constrained to be σγH< 16.4 fb at 95% confidence level (CL). Simultaneous constraints on four anomalous couplings involving HZγ and Hγγ are provided. Additionally, the production rate for H→ 4ℓ is examined to assess potential enhancements in the Yukawa couplings between light quarks and the Higgs boson. Assuming the standard model values for the Yukawa couplings of the bottom and top quarks, the following simultaneous constraints are obtained: κu=(0.0±1.5)× 103, κd=(0.0±7.1)× 102, κs= 0+33− 34, and κc= 0.0+2. 7− 3.0. This rules out the hypothesis that up-or down-type quarks in the first or second generation have the same Yukawa couplings as those in the third generation, with a CL greater than 95%.\n\nTitle: Search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons in proton-proton collision events with a lepton-jet pair associated with a secondary vertex at = 13 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nA search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb− 1 collected at= 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC is presented. Events are selected with a charged lepton originating from the primary vertex associated with the proton-proton interaction, as well as a second charged lepton and a hadronic jet associated with a secondary vertex that corresponds to the semileptonic decay of a long-lived HNL. No excess of events above the standard model expectation is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are evaluated for HNLs that mix with electron and/or muon neutrinos. Limits are presented in the mass range of 1–16.5 GeV, with excluded square mixing parameter values reaching as low as 2× 10− 7. For masses above 11 GeV, the presented limits exceed all previous results in the semileptonic decay channel …\n\nTitle: The effect of radiation damage on the light yield and uniformity of candidate plastic scintillator tiles for the CMS hadron calorimeter upgrade\n\nDescription:\n\nA study has been performed to understand the effects of radiation damage on various plastic scintillator tiles considered for a possible upgrade of the hadron calorimeter of the CMS detector. Measurements were made with unirradiated tiles and with tiles that had been irradiated in the CMS collision hall to a dose of 44 kGy. Results are presented for the tiles of different shapes in terms of the energy spectrum, efficiency as a function of the position at which each tile was hit, as well as light yield. All the tiles showed a light reduction of up to about 50%. The tiles with the shape currently used in the CMS detector did not see increased non-uniformity of light collection, while a significant disuniformity was observed for the tiles considered as alternatives.\n\n', 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=miOPDIcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'eno@umd.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': 'C.', 'added_to_pinecone': False}], count=None)

Highly cited papers undoubtedly represent influential work, affecting the creation of review standards and conference submission and acceptance practices within and beyond CHI. However, the factors contributing to high citation counts and what constitutes a highly cited CHI paper remain largely unclear. In this panel discussion, we will engage the CHI community in exploring the relationship between paper characteristics, citation numbers, and effective impact on HCI as a discipline, and on HCI as an influential endeavour in technology design and development. To ground this discussion, we present findings from a literature review of the 100 most cited CHI full papers, looking at past and present fields and subfields of influence. We will also share insights from HCI experts. Our goals are to shed light on the meaning of impactful work at CHI and in HCI more broadly, to reflect on key trends in HCI over the years, and to discuss themes that have driven pivotal shifts in HCI research. We will lead the conversation toward a deeper understanding of citation practices, the role of citations in focusing and driving HCI research, and the implications of citation when it comes to shaping what is considered impactful HCI.\n\nTitle: Commentary: the future of human-robot interactions\n\nDescription:\n\nService robots are poised for enormous impact helping to achieve the U.N Sustainable Development goals as well as supporting older adults and young learners. This article briefly explores these application areas in three invited commentaries written by leading scholars and an industry entrepreneur, expressing their varied perspectives on the future of service robots. The article accompanies this Journal of Service Research special issue on human-robot interactions. In their commentaries, the authors share views on areas of personal interest ranging from global grand challenges to healthy aging and educational development. Included within each commentary are managerial insights and suggestions for needed research in the highlighted area.\n\n', 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=h4i4fh8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'ben@cs.umd.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': '', 'added_to_pinecone': False}], count=None)
