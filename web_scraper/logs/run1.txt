EIC [8] is also among possible recipients of the R&D program developed in this DRD-on-Calorimetry. The ECFA Detector Roadmap [9] has defined the following Detector R&D Themes (DRDTs):\n\nTitle: Small- evolution of gluon fields from incoherent photoproduction in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions\n\nDescription:\n\nIncoherent J/ψ photoproduction in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), in which the photon interacts with localized, fluctuating gluonic hotspots rather than the entire nucleus, provides a unique probe of those fluctuations. This study presents the first measurement of the dependence of this photoproduction yield on the photonnucleon center-of-mass energy (WγN), using PbPb UPCs at a nucleon-nucleon centerof-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The data corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.52 nb− 1, recorded by the CMS experiment. The measurement covers a wide WγN range of≈ 40–400 GeV, probing gluons carrying a fraction of nucleon momentum x in the range between 5.9× 10− 3 and 6.5× 10− 5. The measured incoherent J/ψ photoproduction cross section is suppressed relative to theoretical predictions without nuclear effects. However, the ratio of incoherent to coherent photoproduction remains constant across the probed WγN and x range. Together, these results pose significant challenges to current theoretical models which include gluon saturation or nuclear shadowing effects.\n\nTitle: Observation of the charged-particle multiplicity dependence of in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nBound states of charm and anticharm quarks, known as charmonia, have a rich spectroscopic structure that can be used to probe the dynamics of hadron production in high-energy hadron collisions. Here, the cross section ratio of excited and ground state vector mesons is measured as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass (CM) energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 175 nb were collected using the CMS detector. The ratio is measured separately for prompt and nonprompt charmonia in the transverse momentum range 6.530 GeV and in four rapidity ranges spanning 2.865 1.935. For the first time, a statistically significant multiplicity dependence of the prompt cross section ratio is observed in proton-nucleus collisions. There is no clear rapidity dependence in the ratio. The prompt measurements are compared with a theoretical model which includes interactions with nearby particles during the evolution of the system. These results provide additional constraints on hadronization models of heavy quarks in nuclear collisions.\n\nTitle: arXiv: The IDEA detector concept for FCC-ee\n\nDescription:\n\nA detector concept, named IDEA, optimized for the physics and running conditions at the FCC-ee is presented. After discussing the expected running conditions and the main physics drivers, a detailed description of the individual sub-detectors is given. These include: a very light tracking system with a powerful vertex detector inside a large drift chamber surrounded by a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual readout fiber calorimeter and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke. Some examples of the expected detector performance, based on fast and full simulation, are also given.\n\nTitle: Search for medium effects using jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets from PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nThe jet axis decorrelation in inclusive jets is studied using lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The jet axis decorrelation is defined as the angular difference between two definitions of the jet axis. It is obtained by applying two recombination schemes on all the constituents of a given jet reconstructed by the anti-kT sequential algorithm with a distance parameter of R= 0.4. The data set, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.66 nb− 1, was collected in 2018 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The jet axis decorrelations are examined across collision centrality selections and intervals of jet transverse momentum. A centrality dependent evolution of the measured distributions is observed, with a progressive narrowing seen in more central events. This narrowing could result from medium-induced modification of the internal jet structure or reflect color charge effects in energy loss. This new measurement probes jet substructure in previously unexplored kinematic domains and show great promise for providing new insights on the color charge dependence of energy loss to jet-quenching models.\n\nTitle: Observation of hyperon local polarization in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nThe polarization of the A and A hyperons along the beam direction has been measured in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data were obtained with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0±6.5 nb− 1. A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon polarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient Pz, s2, is observed. The Pz, s2 values decrease as a function of charged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A hydrodynamic model that describes the observed Pz, s2 values in nucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce either the sign or the magnitude of the pPb results. These observations pose a challenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in heavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin polarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.\n\nTitle: Evidence for similar collectivity of high transverse momentum particles in pPb and PbPb collisions\n\nDescription:\n\nCharged hadron elliptic anisotropies (v2) are presented over a wide transverse momentum (pT) range for proton-lead (pPb) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at nucleonnucleon center-of-mass energies of 8.16 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment and correspond to integrated luminosities of 186 nb− 1 and 0.607 nb− 1 for the pPb and PbPb systems, respectively. A four-particle cumulant analysis is performed using subevents separated in pseudorapidity to effectively suppress non-collective effects. At high pT (pT> 8 GeV), significant positive v2 values are observed that are similar between pPb and PbPb collisions at comparable charged particle multiplicities. This observation suggests a common origin for the multi-particle collectivity for high-pT particles in the two systems.\n\nTitle: Search for production and constraints on the Yukawa couplings of light quarks to the Higgs boson\n\nDescription:\n\nA search for γH production is performed with data from the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138fb− 1 at a proton-proton center-of-mass collision energy of 13TeV. The analysis focuses on the topology of a boosted Higgs boson recoiling against a high-energy photon. The final states of H→ bb and H→ 4ℓ are analyzed. This study examines effective HZγ and Hγγ anomalous couplings within the context of an effective field theory. In this approach, the production cross section is constrained to be σγH< 16.4 fb at 95% confidence level (CL). Simultaneous constraints on four anomalous couplings involving HZγ and Hγγ are provided. Additionally, the production rate for H→ 4ℓ is examined to assess potential enhancements in the Yukawa couplings between light quarks and the Higgs boson. Assuming the standard model values for the Yukawa couplings of the bottom and top quarks, the following simultaneous constraints are obtained: κu=(0.0±1.5)× 103, κd=(0.0±7.1)× 102, κs= 0+33− 34, and κc= 0.0+2. 7− 3.0. This rules out the hypothesis that up-or down-type quarks in the first or second generation have the same Yukawa couplings as those in the third generation, with a CL greater than 95%.\n\nTitle: Search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons in proton-proton collision events with a lepton-jet pair associated with a secondary vertex at = 13 TeV\n\nDescription:\n\nA search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb− 1 collected at= 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC is presented. Events are selected with a charged lepton originating from the primary vertex associated with the proton-proton interaction, as well as a second charged lepton and a hadronic jet associated with a secondary vertex that corresponds to the semileptonic decay of a long-lived HNL. No excess of events above the standard model expectation is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are evaluated for HNLs that mix with electron and/or muon neutrinos. Limits are presented in the mass range of 1–16.5 GeV, with excluded square mixing parameter values reaching as low as 2× 10− 7. For masses above 11 GeV, the presented limits exceed all previous results in the semileptonic decay channel …\n\nTitle: The effect of radiation damage on the light yield and uniformity of candidate plastic scintillator tiles for the CMS hadron calorimeter upgrade\n\nDescription:\n\nA study has been performed to understand the effects of radiation damage on various plastic scintillator tiles considered for a possible upgrade of the hadron calorimeter of the CMS detector. Measurements were made with unirradiated tiles and with tiles that had been irradiated in the CMS collision hall to a dose of 44 kGy. Results are presented for the tiles of different shapes in terms of the energy spectrum, efficiency as a function of the position at which each tile was hit, as well as light yield. All the tiles showed a light reduction of up to about 50%. The tiles with the shape currently used in the CMS detector did not see increased non-uniformity of light collection, while a significant disuniformity was observed for the tiles considered as alternatives.\n\n', 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=miOPDIcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'eno@umd.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': 'C.', 'added_to_pinecone': False}], count=None)

The present invention is also directed to methods of making the solid state electrolyte materials and methods of using the solid state electrolyte materials in batteries and other electrochemical technologies.\n\nTitle: Li+ (ionophore) nanoclusters engineered aqueous/non-aqueous biphasic electrolyte solutions for high-potential lithium-based batteries\n\nDescription:\n\nThe use of aqueous/non-aqueous biphasic electrolyte solutions in Li-based battery systems circumvents the limitations of poor reductive stability of aqueous electrolyte solutions, broadening their electrochemical stability window. However, aqueous/non-aqueous electrolytes suffer from biphasic mixing and high impedance when Li ions cross the biphasic interface. Here we propose the use of 12-crown-4 (12C4) and tetraglyme (G4) as lithium ionophores to form Li+(ionophore) nanoclusters in both non-aqueous and aqueous phases to overcome the interface challenges in biphasic electrolytes. The Li+(ionophore) nanoclusters have the H 2 O-excluding inner Li+ solvation structure in non-polar 1, 1, 2, 2-tetrafluoroethyl 2, 2, 3, 3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE), allowing fast charge transport across the biphasic interface without solvent mixing or water shuttling.

Here, we propose a universal design of thin Li‐metal anode (LMA) via a dynamic stability strategy to address these issues. The ultra‐thin LMA (20\u2005μm) is in situ constructed with uniform highly Li‐ion conductive solid‐electrolyte interphase and composite‐polymer interphase (CPI) via electroplating process. As a result, the passivation layer with poor Li‐ion conduction on Li anode can be dissolved and small surface resistance can be achieved due to the good compatibility of CPI to SSEs. The cycling of Li symmetric cell with Li6PS5Cl thin film electrolyte (<100\u2005μm) shows a high critical current density of >2.0\u2005mA\u2009cm−2 …\n\nTitle: Revitalizing interphase in all-solid-state Li metal batteries by electrophile reduction\n\nDescription:\n\nAll-solid-state lithium metal batteries promise high levels of safety and energy density, but their practical realization is limited by low Li reversibility, limited cell loading and demand for high-temperature and high-pressure operation, stemming from solid-state electrolyte (SSE) low-voltage reduction and high-voltage decomposition, and from lithium dendrite growth. Here we concurrently address these challenges by reporting that a family of reductive electrophiles gain electrons and cations from metal–nucleophile materials (here a Li sulfide SSE) upon contact to undergo electrochemical reduction and form interphase layers (named solid reductive-electrophile interphase) on material surfaces. The solid reductive-electrophile interphase is electron blocking and lithiophobic, prevents SSE reduction, suppresses Li dendrites and supports high-voltage cathodes. Consequently, a reductive-electrophile-treated SSE exhibits …\n\n', 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vP1d_vMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'cswang@umd.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': '', 'added_to_pinecone': False}], count=None)

The pulmonary vasculature is highly sensitive to NO and hemolysis is linked to pulmonary hypertension (PH). In erythrocytes, the pentose phosphate pathway generates reduced NADPH, a requirement for glutathione reduction, a RBC antioxidant. G6PD is the rate limiting enzyme in this pathway and individuals deficient for G6PD experience intravascular hemolysis resulting from decreased ROS buffering capacity. There is conflicting data in animal models of G6PD deficiency and PH, with some showing protective effects and others demonstrating increased propensity for PH.\nMethods\nThe G6PD A- mouse model contains the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resulting in substitution of methionine for valine at the 68th position. The …\n\nTitle: Evaluation of a Novel Oxygen Carrier for Resuscitation in Hemorrhagic Shock Model Using a Target Mutation of Recombinant Heme Protein\n\nDescription:\n\nIntroduction: Hemorrhagic shock remains a leading cause of preventable death in warfare or acute trauma. Thus, the ongoing research for a successful artificial oxygen carrier as an alternative to blood. Our protein, the Bacterial Regulator of Carbon Monoxide Metabolism (RcoM), helps bridge this gap through its easily sourced nature, reproducibility, and effectiveness in delivering oxygen to the tissues. RCom is an engineered variant that lacks a DNA binding domain and contains cysteine mutations for improved stability (RcoM HBD-CCC), this optimized it's ligand binding ability, autoxidation rate, thermostability and nitric reduction rate. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that resuscitation with RcoM would improve mean arterial pressure (MAP) in hemorrhagic shock more than crystalloid resuscitation. Methods: A murine model of traumatic hemorrhagic shock was anesthetized with 1.5% isofluorane and received a …\n\nTitle: Compositions and methods for the treatment of carboxyhemoglobinemia\n\nDescription:\n\nDescribed herein is a new antidote for the rapid elimination of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin, including brain, heart, and red cell hemoglobin. The disclosed therapy involves the use of modified human globins, particularly neuroglobins modified at residue 64 and cytoglobins modified at residue 81, which bind carbon monoxide with extremely high affinity. The monomeric mutant globins are infused into blood, where they rapidly and irreversibly sequester carbon monoxide, and thus limit toxic effects of carbon monoxide on cellular respiration and oxygen transport and utilization.\n\nTitle: The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low‐and middle‐income countries\n\nDescription:\n\nGlobally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited haemoglobinopathy. The highest burden of SCD is encountered in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), most of which lack the resources to contend with the disease. There is a marked divide between care for individuals with SCD in high‐income countries (HICs) versus LMICs, whereby the few disease‐modifying therapies and curative regimens are only accessible to those in HICs. As such, blood transfusion remains central to the emergent treatment and prevention of complications of SCD. However, there are a myriad of related challenges in LMICs, which have impeded efforts to treat patients with SCD effectively. In addition to blood safety and availability, examples that impact SCD specifically include capabilities to detect and/or manage red blood cell alloimmunization, capacity for automated red cell exchange, limited immunohematology …\n\nTitle: Reduced oxygen carriers and their use for the treatment of carboxyhemoglobinemia\n\nDescription:\n\nQ methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including explanations of terms, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\nTitle: Macitentan for heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction and pulmonary vascular disease: results of the SERENADE randomized clinical trial and open-label …\n\nDescription:\n\nDespite favorable hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects, endothelin receptor antagonists have not improved outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), possibly because they cause fluid retention.\n\nTitle: Arginine metabolism is a biomarker of red blood cell and human aging\n\nDescription:\n\nIncreasing global life expectancy motivates investigations of molecular mechanisms of aging and age‐related diseases. This study examines age‐associated changes in red blood cells (RBCs), the most numerous host cell in humans. Four cohorts, including healthy individuals and patients with sickle cell disease, were analyzed to define age‐dependent changes in RBC metabolism. Over 15,700 specimens from 13,757 humans were examined, a major expansion over previous studies of RBCs in aging. Multi‐omics approaches identified chronological age‐related alterations in the arginine pathway with increased arginine utilization in RBCs from older individuals. These changes were consistent across healthy and sickle cell disease cohorts and were influenced by genetic variation, sex, and body mass index. Integrating multi‐omics data and metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) in humans and 525 diversity …\n\nTitle: Engineering a highly selective, hemoprotein-based scavenger as a carbon monoxide poisoning antidote with no hypertensive effect\n\nDescription:\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning causes 50,000-100,000 emergency department visits and ∼1,500 deaths in the United States annually. Current treatments are limited to supplemental and/or hyperbaric oxygen to accelerate CO elimination. Even with oxygen therapy, nearly half of CO poisoning survivors suffer long-term cardiac and neurocognitive deficits related to slow CO clearance, highlighting a need for point of care antidotal therapies. Given the natural interaction between CO and ferrous heme, we hypothesized that the hemoprotein RcoM, a transcriptional regulator of microbial CO metabolism, would make an ideal platform for CO-selective scavenging from endogenous hemoproteins. We engineered an RcoM truncate (RcoM-HBD-CCC) that exhibits high CO affinity (Ka,CO = 2.8×1010 M-1), remarkable selectivity for CO over oxygen (Ka,O2 = 1.4×105 M-1; Ka,CO/Ka,O2 = 1.9×105), thermal stability (Tm = 72°C), slow autoxidation rate (kox = 1.1 h-1). In a murine model of acute CO poisoning, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC accelerated CO clearance from hemoglobin in red blood cells and was rapidly excreted in urine. Moreover, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC elicited minimal hypertension in mice compared to infused hemoglobin, attributed to a comparatively limited reactivity toward nitric oxide (NO) via dioxygenation (kNOD(RcoM) = 6-8×106 M-1s-1 vs kNOD(Hb) = 6-8×107 M-1s-1). These data suggest that RcoM-HBD-CCC is a safe, selective, and efficacious CO scavenger. Additionally, by limiting hypertension RcoM-HBD-CCC improves end-organ adverse effects compared with hemoglobin-based therapeutics.\n\n", 'gs_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8Tg5310AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate', 'email': 'umsomdean@som.umaryland.edu', 'body_resume': None, 'middle_name_initial': 'T.
